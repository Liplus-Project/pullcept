//! The topics of one room: a directory of topic files, and the index that
//! annotates it.
//!
//! ```text
//! {dir}/index.json      one entry per topic: name, when it was made,
//!                       and the session each account was in
//! {dir}/{topic}.jsonl   one topic's posts, append-only
//! {dir}/attachments/{topic}/{name}
//!                       the files attached to its posts (#223)
//! ```
//!
//! **The directory is what exists; the index annotates it.** A topic's posts
//! are the file, and [`read`] adopts any `.jsonl` it finds without an entry.
//! That is what makes lazy creation safe — a launch mints a topic and writes
//! nothing, so a run where nothing was said leaves no row in the list, and a
//! crash between the post reaching the file and the entry reaching the index
//! closes because the file alone is enough to rebuild the entry (#115).
//!
//! It is also what fixes the shape of a delete. The entry is an annotation, so
//! removing it removes an annotation: the file is still there, and the next
//! read adopts it back under a rebuilt entry. A topic is deleted by deleting
//! the file, and the entry goes with it (#119, decision 1). [`delete`] does
//! both in that order, and the test that matters here is the one that runs the
//! other order and watches the topic come back.
//!
//! Everything in this crate takes the room's directory as an argument. The path
//! to it is resolved by the app (`src-tauri/src/room_log.rs`), which is also
//! where the lock over read-modify-write of the index lives, and where the
//! screen is told the list has changed. What is here is the part that had to be
//! reachable by `cargo test`: `src-tauri` is compiled but not tested, for the
//! reason docs/5-development.md gives under テストの配置.
